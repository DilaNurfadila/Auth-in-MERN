# Auth-in-MERN
### What is Authentication?

Authentication is the process of determining whether someone or something is, in fact, who or what it says it is.

### What is MERN?

MERN is stands for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. MERN Stack is a Javascript Stack that is used for easier and faster deployment of full-stack web applications.

1. MongoDB: Cross-platform Document-Oriented Database

MongoDB is a NoSQL database where each record is a document comprising of key-value pairs that are similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects.

2. Express: Back-End Framework

Express is a Node.js framework. Rather than writing the code using Node.js and creating loads of Node modules, Express makes it simpler and easier to write the back-end code.

3. React: Front-End Library

React is a JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces.

4. Node.js: JS Runtime Environment

Node.js provides a JavaScript Environment which allows the user to run their code on the server (outside the browser).
